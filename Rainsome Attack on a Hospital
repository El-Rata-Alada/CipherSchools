In this ransomware attack, the CIA Triad Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability was clearly violated.
Availability was directly affected, as systems were locked and critical services like surgeries were halted.
Confidentiality may have been compromised if patient records were accessed or copied.
Integrity is at risk too, since there’s no guarantee that the data, even if recovered, hasn’t been tampered with.

This incident involves both Personally Identifiable Information and Critical Information Infrastructure.
Patient records contain sensitive PII such as names, health history, and identification details.
Since the hospital is part of the healthcare sector—considered CII due to its importance to public health and safety—the disruption impacts not just individuals but society at large.

To prevent such incidents, the hospital should adopt a cybersecurity framework like the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.
This includes identifying critical assets, protecting systems with access controls and encryption,
detecting threats with real-time monitoring, responding quickly to incidents, and recovering through backups and incident response plans.
Regular staff training, updated software, and coordination with national cybersecurity agencies are also key parts of a long-term security strategy.
